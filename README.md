# cookiecutter-python-script-template

Just the bare essentials to write a script in Python with proper Python tooling support:

- black
- flake8
- isort
- mypy
- pytest

## To initialize a new script directory:

Initialize the directory:

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/fwojciec/cookiecutter-python-script-template
```

Change to the newly created directory, set up a virtual environment (if needed) and run to install dev dependencies:

```
pip install -U -r reqirements-dev.txt
```
